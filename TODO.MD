NTH
- Refactor initializers -> To have constants injected vs copy-paste
- Consider adding tests for each class / functionality -> Separate file with unit tests for all classes

END GOAL
- Add variants of Troves and System to compare -> Sub-Classes so we can sim out different results

RESULTS
- Create "Fit" function to give a score to the sims and systems

UI
- Create a way to display the functionality, adding step functions -> NO IDEA

PRICE
- Check pricing -> Decide what to denominate as, every function uses this

BORROWER
- Liquidated Trove -> If liquidate need to adapt behaviour
- Adding Funds behaviour -> Consider allowing some orrowers to have some sort of DCA strat and have them behave based on that
